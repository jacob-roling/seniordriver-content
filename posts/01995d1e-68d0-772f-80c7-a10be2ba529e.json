Now, Suzuki Australia is pleased to confirm that the temporary sales hold on the Jimny XL has now been officially lifted, with deliveries to customers set to begin immediately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of July, Suzuki Australia announced a temporary pause in sales of the Jimny XL while Suzuki Motor Corporation conducted an investigation into the model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During this time, and with no confirmed timeframe for resolution, Suzuki advised its dealer network to prioritise customer experience by offering deposit refunds for customers that are waiting for vehicle deliveries.<br><br>Suzuki’s strong global reputation for quality and reliability, earned over more than 100 years, was the foundation for this proactive step. The decision to temporarily halt sales reflects on our brand’s uncompromising commitment to ensuring these standards remain.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://www.seniordriveraus.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Jimny-XL-five-door-2025-04-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-20212\" srcset=\"https://www.seniordriveraus.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Jimny-XL-five-door-2025-04-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.seniordriveraus.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Jimny-XL-five-door-2025-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.seniordriveraus.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Jimny-XL-five-door-2025-04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.seniordriveraus.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Jimny-XL-five-door-2025-04.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Michael Pachota, General Manager for Automobiles said, “Our customers’ well established trust in Suzuki is built on the promise that quality and safety always come first.”&nbsp;<br><br>“While this pause was undoubtedly disruptive, it was absolutely the right step to ensure we deliver on this promise.”&nbsp;<br><br>“I want to personally thank our customers and dealer partners for their patience and support throughout this period. With sales now resuming, we’re excited to continue delivering one of the most loved vehicles in our line-up for Australian drivers.” said Pachota.<br><br>Concluding the investigation, Suzuki Motor Corporation has confirmed that there are no concerns regarding the Jimny XL’s quality, safety, performance or compliance.<br><br>Effective immediately, wholesale and retail sales may resume, and stock held at ports and yards can now be released.</p>"
