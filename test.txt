<p>CUPRA IS DELIVERING MAJOR UPGRADES to its sporty Leon&nbsp;hatchback with the addition of a highly desirable and practical Sportstourer wagon plus a complete trio of enjoyably efficient mild hybrid, 221kW performance petrol and plugÂ­ in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arriving in Australia in Q4 2025, the Cupra Leon Hatch and Sportstourer range from $46,990 for the S mild hybrid, to $64,990 (both plus on road costs) for the hi-po VZx that now benefits from a new Extreme Package option, or $69,990 for the ultimate combination of space and electrified pace, the VZe Sportstourer with up to 121km of WLTP electric range.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Cupra Leon brings the brand&#8217;s new edgy Spanish design language DNA to the segment, with its shark-nose front end, integrated Cupra badge on the bonnet. triangular LED daytime running lights (DRLs), and illuminated CUPRA logo positioned at the centre of the rear LED &#8216;coast-to-coast&#8217; taillights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Available with a 1.5 litre, 110kW petrol unit mated with 48V mild-hybrid technology, the Leon S brings customers accessible driving dynamics paired with real-world efficiency of only 5.4L/100km on the combined cycle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The system uses a 48V starter-generator and lithium-ion battery: efficiency gains and a smooth drive result, in part. from the system allowing the Cupra Leon to coast with the engine switched off during certain driving conditions, recovering energy under braking and bolstering the combustion engine with electric assistance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Turning up the performance dial, the new Cupra Leon Hatch VZx continues to impress with its acclaimed 2.0 litre petrol unit offering 221kW and 400Nm, dispatching 0-100km/h in a brisk 5.7 seconds. This is paired with a 7-speed DSG dual-clutch transmission, translating power to the wheels while an integrated front differential lock helps offer greater control of power delivery. The system takes readings from numerous sources &#8211; steering angle, wheel speed and yaw &#8211; to ensure engaging driving dynamics.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://www.seniordriveraus.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/LEON-PA-125_2025_01-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-21495\" srcset=\"https://www.seniordriveraus.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/LEON-PA-125_2025_01-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.seniordriveraus.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/LEON-PA-125_2025_01-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.seniordriveraus.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/LEON-PA-125_2025_01-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.seniordriveraus.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/LEON-PA-125_2025_01-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.seniordriveraus.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/LEON-PA-125_2025_01-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://www.seniordriveraus.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/LEON-PA-125_2025_01-840x630.jpg 840w, https://www.seniordriveraus.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/LEON-PA-125_2025_01-440x330.jpg 440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For customers seeking added practicality without having to sacrifice any of the Leon DNA the new CUPRA Leon Sportstourer VZe has entered the chat.

It&#8217;s no secret how much Australians love a sporty hatchback and with greater diversity in our Leon product offering than ever, we can nail what customers want from the range, while refining that signature Catalan flair,&#8221;&nbsp;Mr Shafer said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Customers can also now finally bring together the desirability and fun dynamics of the low-slung Leon with the practicality of the wagon form factor, thanks to the addition of the Sportstourer VZe to the line-up. In addition to the performance, eyebrow-raising fuel economy and the 121km EV range that Cupra&#8217;s new generation PHEV offers, the Sportstourer VZe also brings a generous level of boot space that previously forced a shift to a higher-riding SUV.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As has always been part of its DNA, all Leons have one thing in common: they focus on the driver and being fun to drive, as well as having specifications that start where others end, a strong value proposition that draws customers in from the established premium brands and above all, attractive Barcelona-inspired styling. These are the pillars on which we&#8217;ve built the Cupra brand in Australia for the past three years, and the ones that will carry us forward into the future.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>2026 Cupra Leon range:</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Hatch:</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>â¢ Cupra Leon S</td><td>&nbsp;$46,990</td></tr><tr><td>â¢ Cupra Leon VZx</td><td>&nbsp;$64,990</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Sportstourer:</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>â¢ Cupra Leon Sportstourer VZe</td><td>&nbsp;$69,990</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>Options:</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Leather &amp; Sound package (Leon S)</td><td>$2200</td></tr><tr><td>Extreme Package (Leon VZx)</td><td>$7600</td></tr><tr><td>Sunroof (Leon Hatch)</td><td>$1800</td></tr><tr><td>Panoramic Sunroof (Leon Sportstourer)</td><td>$2000</td></tr><tr><td>Premium paint</td><td>$620</td></tr><tr><td>Matte paint</td><td>$2650</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
